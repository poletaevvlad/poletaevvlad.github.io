            <u>Rolling dice</u>: rolling arbitrary-sided dice, selecting highest and lowest
            dice results, performing arithmetics. <u>Sheet management</u>: creating
            constants and saved rolls for easier access, organized into separate sheets.
            <u>Expression analysis</u>: computing probability of any dice roll outcome.
            <u>History</u>: every roll a user makes is saved for future access.
